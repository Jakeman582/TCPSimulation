My program is almost a straightforward implementation as described in the program document

Compiling
    To compile the client:
        linux> gcc UDPEchoClient.c utilities.c -o UDPEchoClient
    To compile the server:
        linux> gcc UDPEchoServer.c utilities.c -o UDPEchoServer

    ***All files in the zip folder must be extracted and be residing in the same directory

Running
    To run the client:
        linux> ./UDPEchoClient <ip address> <port>
    To run the server:
        linux> ./UDPEchoServer <port> [<DROP 1> <DROP 2> ...]

Limitations:
    Currently if the server is specified to drop numbered packets, then the client may report
    that it is trying to send packets with sequence numbers outside of the expected range.

    I'm sure that if I did not have less than 20 minutes to submit this assignment, this could have been
    easily remedied with additional logic that would "roll the window back", so I may just need to
    carefully consider what happens when a packet times out, and adjust the "base" and "last_sent"
    variables accordingly.

    I also currently do not have a Makefile included with this project. This was one of the last things I
    wanted to do, but I decided to focus on getting the program as accurate as possible before creating
    a Makefile. I have made Makefiles before, so I know it would be super easy to make one for this project,
    but I am less than 10 minutes away from the deadline.
